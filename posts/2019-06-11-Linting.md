The pull request [dhall-lsp-server: Implement linter diagnostics and "Lint and Format" command](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1003/files) implements the second new feature: linting.

- The linter will now contribute diagnostic messages, highlighting possible source code improvements.

- The vscode plugin exposes a new command "Lint and format Dhall file" that runs the linter and formatter on the current file.
