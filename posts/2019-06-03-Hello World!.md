# Hello World!

Hello world! I set up this blog to write about the progress of my *Google Summer of Code* project ["A language server for Dhall"](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5991057626497024).

Have a look at the [proposal pdf](https://eggbaconandspam.github.io/gsoc-proposal.pdf) to check out the details&mdash;in short, I'll be working towards improving the [dhall-lsp-server](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/tree/master/dhall-lsp-server) and accompanying vscode extension [vscode-dhall-lsp-server](https://github.com/PanAeon/vscode-dhall-lsp-server), polishing existing features and adding new ones (like displaying type information on hover).

A big thank you to [Gabriel](https://github.com/Gabriel439) and [Luke](https://github.com/bubba) for mentoring me on this project! Thank you also to [PanAeon](https://github.com/PanAeon) who kicked off the development to both the Haskell backend and the VSCode extension!
