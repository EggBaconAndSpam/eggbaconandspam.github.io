# My first PR: Improving Error Diagnostics

I just got my first pull request ([link](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/974)) merged into the dhall-haskell master branch! The change fixes the "diagnostic ranges" (the squiggly red lines) reported by the LSP backend. Previously these included any whitespace following the erroneous chunk of code; now they are "tight".

*Previously:*

*Now:*

The fix involved relatively small, localised changes&mdash;perfect for getting acquainted with the existing codebase. Next up: figuring out a way to present Dhall's detailed error explanations!
