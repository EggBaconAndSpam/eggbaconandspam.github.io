# New feature: Explain error messages

My pull request [dhall-lsp-server: Rework diagnostics backend + detailed error messages on hover](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/982) implements the first new feature: detailed error messages. You can now hover over type errors, click "Explain error" and be enlightened!

Note that the messages themselves are still a bit ugly (for example they include ANSI colour codes, which don't mean anything to VSCode); this is going to be fixed upstream in the `dhall` package.
